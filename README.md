### Using Screener()

    from finviz import Screener
    
    tickers = ['AAPL', 'ATVI', 'TSLA']
    filters = ['exch_nasd', 'cap_large']  # Shows companies in NASDAQ with Market Cap from $10bln. to $200bln.
    order = '-price'  # Orders the results by price descending
    rows = 100  # Scrape the first 100 elements only
    
    Screener(tickers, filters, order, quantity=elements)
    Screener.to_csv()
    
    # Creates screener_results.csv file in the current directory

Below, you can see all of the possible arguments that can be passed through Screener():
